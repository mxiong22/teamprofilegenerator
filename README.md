# teamprofilegenerator

## Description 
The motivation of this challenge was to create an application that creates employee cards for each category of manager, engineer, and intern which are then displayed on a html. The user is prompted with certain questions when adding in the employee ie when adding managers, they are asked to add in their office phone number, when adding an engineer, they are asked to add in their GitHib username, and when adding an intern, they are asked to add in their school name. All employees are asked to add their name, and id by default. 
When the user is finished building their team, they can exit the application, and the html with the team members will be generated onto a html displaying each team member.
